    <p class="homepagepg">A black hole is a mysterious thing. It breaks laws of physics, and contains a point of infinite density. The gravitational pull of a black hole is so strong that even light can't escape it. Unfortunately, despite all of our modern knowledge of science, we still know very little about black holes: the fact that they suck in everything in their path and don't reflect any light makes them pretty difficult to study. This website will attempt to educate you on everything that is known about these beautiful monstrosities. Are you ready?</p>
